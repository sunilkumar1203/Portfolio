        <p>
          I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and
          I'm a 21-year-old passionate front-end developer. My journey in coding started during college,
          where I discovered a love for building responsive and user-friendly web interfaces.
          I specialize in React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I have hands-on experience through
          projects like a chatbot and portfolio.
